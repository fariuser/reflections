What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you initialise a repository it creates a git repository which 
can track the changes and commits that you make. That is why you need
to do it, otherwise you won't be able to track your changes.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is like a temporary holding area for files before they are eventually added to the repository.
