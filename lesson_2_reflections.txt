What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you initialise a repository it creates a git repository which 
can track the changes and commits that you make. That is why you need
to do it, otherwise you won't be able to track your changes.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is like a temporary holding area for files before they are eventually added to the repository.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

You can use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change by 
using git diff to see the difference with the working directory. This way changes not yet
added can be seen. Also, you can use git diff --staged to see the difference with the repository; in other words temporary changes which still need to be committed.
