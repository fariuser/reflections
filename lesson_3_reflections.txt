When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

I would want to use a remote repository when I am working away from my local pc. 
This would allow me to access my files on different computers.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

I would want to pull changes manually because this would allow me to only pull when important changes have been made.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

A fork is when you 'clone/copy' somebody else's repository on GitHub. 
A clone is when you 'clone/copy' a repository from YOUR own GitHub repository (remote) to a local computer, or from one local computer to another. 
Branch happens on a single repository.
